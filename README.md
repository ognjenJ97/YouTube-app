# YouTube-like Video Platform Project

## This project is a comprehensive exercise that brings together a SQL database, Java backend, and a React frontend to create a smaller version of a YouTube-like video sharing platform. The aim of this exercise is to build a platform where users can upload, comment, like, dislike, subscribe, and unsubscribe, while also offering advanced features like profile editing, video privacy settings, and user administration capabilities.

## Features

- User Interaction: Users can upload videos, leave comments, and interact with videos through likes and dislikes, similar to the functionalities found on popular video-sharing platforms.

- Subscription System: Users can subscribe or unsubscribe from other users' channels to receive notifications and updates about their content.

- Profile Management: Users can edit their profile information, updating details such as their username, avatar, and other personal information.

- Video Customization: Video owners have the ability to make their videos private, disable likes, dislikes, or comments on their videos, granting them greater control over their content.

- Admin Privileges: Admin users have additional capabilities, including the ability to edit other users' videos (with certain limitations), block videos, and manage user accounts.

## Technology Stack

- Backend: The project utilizes Java with a service layer, implementation, repository, DTO objects, and controllers to manage and process user data and requests. The backend server is configured to run on port 8080.

- Frontend: The frontend is built using React(first version) and Angular(second version), offering a user-friendly interface for uploading, interacting with videos, and managing user accounts.

## Installation

1. Install Node.js (v14 or later)
2. Install Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 11

5. Install Apache Tomcat (https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)
6. Clone the repository
7. Configure the backend - Edit the application.properties file to match your local database configuration.
8. Run the backend
9. Configure the frontend - Run npm install to install dependencies
10. Run npm start to start the development server
Please note: For steps 4 and 5, you will need to follow the instructions provided on the respective websites to properly install Maven and Apache Tomcat on your machine.
