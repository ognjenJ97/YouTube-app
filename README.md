#YouTube-like Video Platform Project
##This project is a comprehensive exercise that brings together a SQL database, Java backend, and a React frontend to create a smaller version of a YouTube-like video sharing platform. The aim of this exercise is to build a platform where users can upload, comment, like, dislike, subscribe, and unsubscribe, while also offering advanced features like profile editing, video privacy settings, and user administration capabilities.

##Features
-User Interaction: Users can upload videos, leave comments, and interact with videos through likes and dislikes, similar to the functionalities found on popular video-sharing platforms.

-Subscription System: Users can subscribe or unsubscribe from other users' channels to receive notifications and updates about their content.

-Profile Management: Users can edit their profile information, updating details such as their username, avatar, and other personal information.

-Video Customization: Video owners have the ability to make their videos private, disable likes, dislikes, or comments on their videos, granting them greater control over their content.

A-dmin Privileges: Admin users have additional capabilities, including the ability to edit other users' videos (with certain limitations), block videos, and manage user accounts.

##Technology Stack
-Backend: The project utilizes Java with a service layer, implementation, repository, DTO objects, and controllers to manage and process user data and requests. The backend server is configured to run on port 8080.

-Frontend: The frontend is built using React, offering a user-friendly interface for uploading, interacting with videos, and managing user accounts.

##Installation and Setup
1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Navigate to the backend directory and run the Java backend server on port 8080.
3) Navigate to the frontend directory, enter npm update and start the React development server.
Open your web browser and access the project at http://localhost:3000.
